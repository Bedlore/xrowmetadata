Some changes were made to the sitemap generation module :

2010-12-24
* Exclude default siteaccess name from URLs in generated sitemap


2010-12-29
* Proxying generated sitemaps with a new module in order for Google Webmaster Tools not 
  to consider sitemap as var/<vardir>/storage/sitemap/<domain>/ subdirectory only sitemap but as a 
  global sitemap
  
  - Generated files were renamed according to the following pattern :
  	var/<vardir>/storage/sitemap/<siteaccess>_sitemap.xml
  - a new index_sitemapproxy.php was created to proxy sitemap files data as if in root directory
  	You've got to symlink or copy this file in root directory and add the following lines in .htaccess :
  	
  	RewriteRule ^(.+)_sitemap\.xml$ index_sitemapproxy.php
	RewriteRule ^index_sitemapproxy\.php - [L]
